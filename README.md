# FCN-graph
Complex network theory has been successful at unveiling the topology of the brain and showing alterations to the network structure due to brain disease, cognitive function and behavior. Functional connectivity networks (FCNs) represent different brain regions as the nodes and the connectivity between them as the edges of a graph. Graph theoretic measures provide a way to extract features from these networks enabling subsequent characterization and discrimination of networks across conditions. Specifically, graph theoretic measures such as the path length and clustering coefficient have helped to characterize small-world brain networks, and the degree distribution has been utilized to characterize scale-free networks. Over the last decade, the study of FCNs through complex network theory has provided new means for discriminating between different neural dysfunctions such as epilepsy, depression, Alzheimers Disease and Parkinsons Disease. 

This project aims to extract some meaningful graph theoretic features from a functional connectivity brain network dataset that was collected during a cognitive control related error processing study. After extracting these features, my goal is to use these features to develop some classification models that can discriminate between FCNs constructed across different experimental conditions. 

Required data set can be found in 'FCNdata.zip ' folder. For any information, please send me an email at muniatam(AT)msu(DOT)edu
